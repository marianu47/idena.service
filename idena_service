1) Navigate in the right path: #cd /etc/systemd/system/
2) create a systemd unit file: #touch idena.service
3) set permissions and paste below content into the idena.service file: #chmod 755 idena.service
   #exec start still needs some work done as it does not read the arguments correctly everytime
   #this may show you in the desktop client that you are a first time miner in idena and not view your remote node
#

4) Reload systemd daemon to read unit files changes, enable it to autostart and start the service:
#systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable idena && systemctl start idena
6) Reboot and check with: #systemctl status idena
   You can also check just by connecting with the client to the node
Good Luck!
